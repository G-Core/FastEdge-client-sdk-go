# FastEdge Client SDK

This SDK allows to communicate with Gcore's FastEdge API.

SDK code is generated from OpenAPI spec. The maintainers of the repo keep generated SDK code up-to-date with FastEdge API spec so typically you would just need to update the code from repo.

However, if you need to re-generate SDK, run `make generate`. Please note that it requires [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen) as a generator.
